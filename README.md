We are making an automated pet feeder system with low cost that can dispense foods for the pets at the scheduled time and also monitors and alerts the staff whether the food is consumed or not. The system will be able to record the time and status of whether the pet has eaten or not.

Inputs needed for the automated pet feeder:
1.	Real-time clock for timer
2.	Feeding schedule which will be set by the staff.
3.	Button for manual override so that staff can control when needed.
4.	Sensor data for food dispensed.

Output needed for automated pet feeder:
1.	Motor-driven mechanism for dispensed food.
2.	LED indicator to know the current status.
3.	Giving alerts if any types of issues occurs.
4.	Records of the feeding.
Possible assumptions for the automated pet feeders are:
1.	Only processes one type of pet food.
2.	Automated feeder will have low memory storage.
3.	Basic sensor will be used to detect whether there is food or not.
4.	Automated pet feeder system will run on main or battery.
5.	Pets need to eat food within the prefixed time.

Possible limitation for the automated pet feeders are:
1.	It doesnâ€™t process all the type of pet foods.
2.	Limited  memory storage 
3.	Accuracy will be directly be dependend on the quality of sensor used.
4.	Food refills will be done manually.
